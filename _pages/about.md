I learned to appreciate the beauty in data and the diverse interpretations that can be derived from it. This realization inspired me to consider how to communicate my own story through data. I believe that continuous learning is crucial to staying ahead in this field.

Over the past year, I have completed various online courses and achieved certifications to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies:

    (2023, Coursera)
    Health Information Literacy for Data Analytics by University of California, Davis (2023, Coursera)
    AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (2022, AWS)
    Tableau Desktop Specialist (2022, Tableau)
    Machine Learning by Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI (2022, Coursera)
    Google Data Analytics (2022, Coursera)

The list of skills and accomplishments I have acquired is still growing. My journey has just begun.
