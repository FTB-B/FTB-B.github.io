## <a id="introduction">1. Introduction</a>

This is the final project of the online course [Udacity A/B Testing by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257). It's based on an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. Let me walk you through about how to design the experiment, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment. The [project instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub) contain more details.
