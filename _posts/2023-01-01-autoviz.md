AutoViz is an open-source Python library that helps automate the process of visualizing data. It's particularly useful for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) when you first get a dataset and want to understand what's in it.

AutoViz aims to make visualizations as simple and straightforward as possible by reducing the process to a single function call. The function will automatically generate a number of visualizations based on the features (columns) of your dataset.

Here are some of the things AutoViz can do:
    
    1. Univariate Analysis: AutoViz can create histogram-like charts for each numerical feature and bar charts for each categorical feature. This provides an understanding of the distribution of values in each feature.
    
    2. Bivariate Analysis: AutoViz can automatically identify which features are most relevant to the target variable and generate scatter plots, pair plots, bar plots, box plots, and violin plots to understand the relationship between the target and these features.
    
    3. Correlation Analysis: AutoViz can generate a heatmap to show the correlation between different features.
    
    4. Missing Values Analysis: AutoViz can show if there are missing values in the dataset.
