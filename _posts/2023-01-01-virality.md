## <a id="introduction">1. Introduction</a>
Virality in data generally refers to the rapid spread or increase of information or characteristics in a dataset. It's often used in the context of social media or internet content to describe a post or topic that quickly becomes popular and is widely shared or mentioned.

In the context of data analysis, a data point, characteristic, or value could be considered "viral" if its frequency or occurrence significantly increases in a short period of time.

Here's an example related to social media:
    - If a tweet suddenly gets a lot more retweets or likes than usual, it might be considered "viral".
    - If a specific hashtag suddenly gets used much more frequently than others, it might be considered "viral".

Similarly, in sales data:
    - If a particular product's sales suddenly spike within a short period, that product might be considered "viral".
    - If a particular customer's transactions dramatically increase in a given time frame, that customer's activity might be considered "viral".

These are basic examples. Virality can be defined more specifically based on the context and the nature of the data. It might involve specific thresholds or require complex measures depending on the application. Also, keep in mind that "virality" often involves a concept of exponential growth - small numbers of shares leading to larger and larger numbers in a "viral cascade".

Remember, detecting virality is often just the first step - interpreting why something became viral often requires additional context and analysis.

Here are two simple ways to calculate virality score:
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy.stats import zscore
    
    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'timestamp' and 'image_id' are your columns
    
    # Convert your timestamp column to datetime and extract the week number
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
    df['week'] = df['timestamp'].dt.isocalendar().week
    
    # Calculate the counts of each unique image per week
    weekly_counts = df.groupby(['week', 'image_id']).size().reset_index(name='counts')
    
    # Calculate the total counts for each week
    total_counts = weekly_counts.groupby('week')['counts'].sum()
    
    # Calculate the proportion of each item out of the total counts for each week
    weekly_counts['proportion'] = weekly_counts.groupby('week')['counts'].apply(lambda x: x / x.sum())
    
    # Calculate the Z-score of the proportions for each image
    weekly_counts['z_score'] = weekly_counts.groupby('image_id')['proportion'].transform(zscore)
    
    # Define a threshold for Z-score that indicates "going viral"
    viral_threshold = 2.0  # e.g., proportions that are two standard deviations above the mean
    
    # Filter the DataFrame for 'viral' images
    viral_images = weekly_counts[weekly_counts['z_score'] > viral_threshold]
    
    print(viral_images)


### z-score
   
A Z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is used to identify how unusual a data point is. A Z-score of 0 indicates that the data point is perfectly average, a positive Z-score indicates a value higher than the mean, and a negative Z-score indicates a value lower than the mean. By comparing the Z-scores of different data points, you can understand which data points are unusually high or low.

In your case, if you want to identify domains that suddenly become popular (i.e., their share count increases significantly), calculating the Z-score could be a good approach. A high Z-score for a domain on a particular day would indicate that the domain's share count was unusually high on that day. This could potentially be an indicator of a domain going viral.

On the other hand, if you want to understand the trend in a domain's popularity over time (i.e., whether it's generally increasing or decreasing), the moving average would be more appropriate. The moving average would smooth out daily fluctuations and highlight the overall trend.

It's also possible to combine these two methods. For example, you could calculate a moving average of the Z-scores to identify trends in how unusual a domain's share count is. This could potentially identify domains that regularly have unusual spikes in popularity.



### Moving Average (Rolling Mean)
A moving average is used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. When we calculate the moving average of a time series, we calculate the average of the data points within a certain window that moves over time. It's useful for identifying trends and patterns and smoothing out noise in the data.
However, it does not necessarily provide a measure of how unusual or significant a particular observation is in the context of the data.
